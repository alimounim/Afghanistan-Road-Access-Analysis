## Afghanistan

![](https://dumbledorespeacemakers.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/road_network.jpg)

## Introduction and Motivation

Afghanistan's dramatic mountainous terrain presents significant challenges, particularly in transportation infrastructure, healthcare access, and connectivity. Rugged mountains often isolate communities, especially during severe winters, complicating access to essential services like medical facilities and education. Poor road conditions exacerbate these difficulties, severely limiting mobility and economic opportunities for many Afghans.

This project maps and analyzes Afghanistan's transportation networks to identify critical areas needing infrastructure development. The detailed, interactive maps generated highlight regions requiring prioritized intervention, aiming to foster community connectivity, economic growth, and improved living conditions for Afghans.

## Methodology

### Libraries Used

- Terra, geodata, rnaturalearth, ggplot2, tidyverse, sf, tidyterra, tmap, ggspatial, leaflet, osmdata, geojsonsf

### Spatial Analysis

Multiple geographic layers—including national, regional, provincial, and district boundaries—were analyzed. Geographic features like rivers, mountains, and roads were overlaid to evaluate their impact on mobility and accessibility.

### Social Indicators

Population distribution at the district, province, and regional levels were mapped. Health and educational facility distributions were analyzed spatially, emphasizing discrepancies in access.

### Results

Significant disparities were noted:
- Kabul and Hirat provinces displayed better-developed road networks and notably shorter healthcare access times.
- Provinces like Nuristan suffer from inadequate infrastructure, severely limiting accessibility to essential services.

### Conclusions

While geographic challenges contribute to Afghanistan's infrastructure issues, disparities suggest infrastructural development prioritizes urban centers, neglecting rural and mountainous regions. Expanding transportation networks and improving road quality in underserved provinces are vital for equitable development and enhancing overall living standards in Afghanistan.
